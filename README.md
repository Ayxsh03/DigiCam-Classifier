# DigiCam-Classifier
Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks in Python with Keras.
Digit Recognition project leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to build a model capable of identifying and predicting handwritten digits. This system processes images of handwritten digits and outputs the corresponding numeric value (0–9). It utilizes a supervised learning approach, integrating a convolutional neural network (CNN) for robust image processing and feature extraction.

The project demonstrates the application of core machine learning and computer vision concepts, including data preprocessing, model training, and real-time prediction. This solution can be extended to various fields, such as automated form processing, educational tools, and digital banking systems.
